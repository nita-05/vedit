## Assets Folder

Place your static branding files here. For the navbar logo:

1. Save your logo as `vedit-v.png` (ideally 512×512 PNG with transparent background).
2. Put it in this folder (`public/assets/vedit-v.png`).

After dropping the file in, the navbar logo will load automatically from `/vedit-v.png`.
